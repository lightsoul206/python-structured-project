the conversion of integer to string or viceversa

fibannoci sequence=0,1,1,2,3,5(here see,0+1=1,1+1=2,2+1=3,it is the addition of the first number and the previous number)

                                                                   IF/ELSE
we have to make if in each single line for example
if roll==1
	print()
if roll=2
see here the if are in the starting 

whereas
if roll==1
   print()
   if roll==2
here the if is a tab away sp it will be nested elif 

condition of operators:
.And(&)
.OR
.==(equals to)
.!=(not equals to)
.<(smaller than )
.<=(less than equal to)
.>=(greater than equal to)
.>=(greater than)


why it is == not =???
ANS:for example a=5
here the 5 is assigned in a

hence
if
a==5
here it varifies is it 5 or 4 if it is 5 then true(boolean) if it is 4(false(boolean)) 
*difference between if and elif.
in IF we start the statment by this 
in elif we do the statements after if

UNDERSTAND IT AT HOME
roll=6
if(roll!=1)
	print("it is A")
else:
print("it is B")


else
else is anything except if

questions:
.input a password.if the password is abcd1234 then it is valid or else it is not
.input num 1 and num2 multiply both of them if their product is greater than 100 then it is greater if is less than 100 then it is less than
.input num1 and num2 see if num1 is greater than less than or equal to num2
